## Windows

### Pre-Requisites

- Windows 10 or 11. The release zip brings every library it needs, so nothing else has to be installed.
- Firmware dumped from your console
- Keys extracted from your console
- Games dumped from your console
- Internet Connection

### Steps

1. Download the latest `hortensia-windows-x86_64` zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/notsapinho/Eglantine/releases) page.
    <aside>
    
    ***TIP***:  If you have questions about the requirements, architectures, or general information surrounding what release you need - see the [*Basics Guide*](./Basics.md) and [*Architectures Guide*](./Architectures.md).
    
    </aside>
2. Extract the contents to wherever you want to store the program on your computer. 
    <aside>
    
    ***TIP***: If you want to run Eglantine completely portable (everything is stored in the folder you extracted it to) - create a folder called **user** if it is not there by default.
    
    </aside> 
3. Run ***hortensia.exe*** to launch the program.  
    
    <aside>

    ***INFO***: You may get a "*Windows protected your PC"* SmartScreen message that appears.  This is just Windows Defender saying it did not recognize the application and did not run it - Eglantine is completely safe.  Click **More info** and then **Run anyway** to dismiss this message.
    
    </aside>
4. Eglantine will now launch and notify you about missing Decryption keys. Close the dialog box by hitting **OK**.
5. Navigate to **Tools > Install Decryption Keys**, navigate to the folder containing your key files and select the file, you should only be able to select one.
6. Navigate to **Tools > Install Firmware**, *Select **From Folder*** or ***From ZIP*** - depending on how your firmware is stored, navigate to where it is stored and select it.    
7. Double-Click the main window to add the folder containing your games.

## macOS

macOS support is experimental and relies on MoltenVK. There are no macOS release builds: build Eglantine yourself ([Build guide](../Build.md)).

Users of macOS may wish to use [Asahi Linux](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Asahi/Guide) for the rising KosmicKrisp support.

As of writing, neither macOS nor Asahi has support for NCE; additionally Asahi has extraneous paging bugs with fastmem.

### Allowing Eglantine to Run on MacOS

Use this guide when you need to allow Eglantine to run on a Mac system, but are being blocked by Apple Security policy.

**[See here](https://evilperson1337.notion.site/Allowing-Eden-to-Run-on-MacOS-2b057c2edaf681fea63dc81027efeffd) for an illustrated guide (written for Eden).**

##### Pre-Requisites

- Permissions to modify settings in MacOS

---

#### Why am I Seeing This?

Recent versions of MacOS (Catalina & newer) introduced the **Gatekeeper** security functionality, requiring software to be signed by Apple or a trusted (aka - paying) developer.  If the signature isn't on the list of trusted ones, it will stop the program from executing and display the message above.

---

#### Steps

1. Open the *System Settings* panel.
2. Navigate to *Privacy & Security*.
3. Scroll down and observe the following message under the **Security** settings.
4. Select **Open Anyway** to tell your Mac that you trust the application.
5. You will now get another window appearing to verify you want to open Eglantine.  Select **Open Anyway**.
6. You will be prompted for your password to authorize the request.  Enter the credentials of an account that has permission to modify settings and press **OK**.
7. Eglantine will now open and any subsequent launches of the program will not prompt this.
